### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

***

Holding a multidisciplinary background in Mathematics and Analytic Philosophy, I've been studying the data world since 2020. In 2021, I attended the QADS Academy, a 350-hour program in Data Science offered by Qintess in partnership with mesttra. In the same year, I worked at Cidacs (Fiocruz) as a Data Engineer, developing ETL pipelines with Python, Spark and Hadoop and linking big datasets for research projects related to public health. At the beginning of 2022, I worked at A3Data Consulting in a data solutions project for hospitals management. Currently, I work for a Tourism & Travel company - CVC Corp - developing SQL and Python scripts that deliver strategic data to the B2B area.
