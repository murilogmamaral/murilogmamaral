### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

***

Holding a multidisciplinary background in Mathematics and Analytic Philosophy, I made a career switch into tech in 2020. I started working professionally in 2021, having positions as a Data Engineer and Data Analyst. My main competences are Python, PySpark, SQL, Big Data, Databricks, ETL (extraction, transformation and load) and Business Intelligence.
